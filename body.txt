This will be the body of my pretend thesis and practice in utilizing the command line and the use of 
git, and github. 
My podcast has ended so I should pause and select a new one to listen to allowing the time to pass faster. 
Found a podcast as well as found that I have successfully added a new portion which is the body after 
the introduction in the file my thesis! pretty cool~

Yeeeahhhh!

I am finding ways to make this more smoothly, with no errors.
This is awesome to have this work successfully, and this podcast is interesting so its a good time all
around. 
Ha!
