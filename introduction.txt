We were wanderers from the beginning.
Booyah I got in to make changes to this file and I wanna dance but I cannot because I am at work and people would think 
I am odd as well as thinking I am weird 

I am adding another line to see that the changes are able to be seen in Github to see that I can use 
git and github as it should be used properly. 

I have seen the changes and am trying to understand the right way to add. commit and see the changes on
github.
